# Ethical Considerations

As we develop robotics applications, it's important to consider the ethical implications:

- **Safety**: Ensure that robots operate safely in human environments
- **Privacy**: Protect user data collected by robots
- **Transparency**: Make robot behavior understandable to users
- **Accountability**: Establish clear responsibility for robot actions
